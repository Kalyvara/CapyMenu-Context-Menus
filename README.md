# CapyMenu (Context Menus)

![Image](https://api.deckthemes.com/blobs/d805f24e-499e-4b34-8ce5-6cc9234f8bc7)

This theme provides a plethora of options to customize your context menus. Most notable features: near-full control of colors, gradients, multiple layouts, colored blur or image for modal background, etc. I would recommend grabbing the other CapyMenu themes as well to further complete the UI overhaul.

**Note:** Large images for modal background will take longer to load. 1920x1080 is generally fine though. You can store your images wherever you want in `/home/deck/homebrew/themes`
